          Dear <span id="regular_name">regular name</span>, the truth is 2020
          was no doubt a very different year for all of us but I'm glad you and
          I pulled through the year and here we are today counting down to a new
          year. If you look closely, there is at least one thing to be grateful
          for. That our paths ever crossed was not a mistake and I never will
          take that privilege for granted. You are indeed one of the many
          blessings God brought my way. Thank you for 2020. Let's toast to an
          amazing 2021 and many more beautiful years ahead. LOADS OF LOVE.
          CHEERS!!!
